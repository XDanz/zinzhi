        When a client logins to Confd the login procedure is as follows:
        1. If the client tries publickey login first (clients typically
           do that) the username must exist in
           /aaa/authentication/passwdFile
           The third field in that file is used as a directory which may
           contain the ssh keys for the user.
        2. If (1) fails due to either
             - No passwd file is configured
             - user doesn't exist in the passwdFile
             - No ssh_key_dir in the users entry in the passwdFile
             - ssh keys are wrong
           then ssh clients typically try username/passwoed login.
           We then:
             a) Look for the user in the passwdFile and try to match
                the password sent from the client.
             b) if (a) fails we try a PAM login (if pam is enabled)
