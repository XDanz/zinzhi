The Tailf HA Controller packagee implements a High Availablity HA-Controller to
automatically handle simple fail overs between two (2) NCS HA nodes.

The setup is intended to run on two NCS nodes (ha nodes)
Each ha node links (or copy) the package to the packages directory before
starting NCS.

The YANG model defines data model configuration items that both 
HA nodes must load.

Both ha node participating in ha pair is required to load
the package with the same initial configuration.

ha must be enable in ncs.conf for the two nodes. See the example
examples.ncs/web-server-farm/ha how to use this package.

The package consists of yang model which should be loaded by NCS when
linked (or copied) the tailf-ha-controller package.

The package requires configuration of

- names of the two nodes
- IP addresses of the two nodes.
- The cluster ID which is a token which is used to connect the
framework to NCS.


This would typically have to be part of XML initialization files
for the two nodes. For example


  <ha-config xmlns="http://tailf.com/ha">
    <nodes>
      <n1-name>primary</n1-name>
      <n1-address>192.168.128.1</n1-address>
      <n2-name>secondary</n2-name>
      <n2-address>192.168.128.2</n2-address>
    </nodes>
    <cluster-id>clid</cluster-id>
  </ha-config>


The nodes must have the name of the node as an environment variable
thus to start e.g node n1 (on host 192.168.128.1), it must be started
as

$ NCS_HA_NODE=primary ncs -c ncs.conf

The Java code that implements the actions, read this variable to
figure out weather it is node n1 or n2
