Alternatively you can use sed. sed can be used to mimic grep like this:

sed -n 's/pattern/&/p'

By default sed prints every line even if no substitution occurs. The combinations of -n and /p makes sed
print only the lines where a substitution has occured.
Finally, we replace pattern by & which means replace pattern by itself. Result: we just mimicked grep.

Now sed can take a range of lines on which to act. In your case:

sed -n '50000,$s/time spent/&/p' myfile.txt

The format to specify the range is as follow: start,end We just instruct sed to work from line 50000 to $ which means last line.
sed -n 's/pattern/&/p'
